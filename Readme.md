# Vehicle Re-ID Collection
Just for a collection. I do not work on this topic.

## Dataset
1.VeRi-776

2.Vehicle-ID

Comments: Use multiple training sets.

2. Learning Deep Neural Networks for Vehicle Re-ID with Visual-spatio-temporal Path Proposals (ICCV2017)

Comments: Add the time constraint.

3. Exploiting Multi-Grain Ranking Constraints for Precisely Searching Visually-similar Vehicles (ICCV2017)
