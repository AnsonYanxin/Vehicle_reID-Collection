# Vehicle Re-ID Collection
Just for a collection. I do not work on this topic.

## Dataset
1.VeRi-776

2.Vehicle-ID

## Recent Papers
1. Orientation Invariant Feature Embedding and Spatial Temporal Regularization for Vehicle Re-identification (ICCV2017)

2. Learning Deep Neural Networks for Vehicle Re-ID with Visual-spatio-temporal Path Proposals (ICCV2017)

3. Exploiting Multi-Grain Ranking Constraints for Precisely Searching Visually-similar Vehicles (ICCV2017)

Comments: propose a dataset.

4. Viewpoint-aware Attentive Multi-view Inference for Vehicle Re-identification (CVPR2018)
