# Vehicle Re-ID Collection
Just for a collection. I do not work on this topic.

## Dataset
1. [VeRi-776](https://github.com/VehicleReId/VeRidataset)

49,357 images of 776 vehicles from 20 cameras. Like Market-1501 protocol.

2. [PKU Vehicle-ID](https://pkuml.org/resources/pku-vehicleid.html)

90,196 images of 10,319 vehicles. Only two camera views??

3. [PKU-VD](https://pkuml.org/resources/pku-vds.html)

with attribute.

4. [VehicleReID](https://medusa.fit.vutbr.cz/traffic/research-topics/detection-of-vehicles-and-datasets/vehicle-re-identification-for-automatic-video-traffic-surveillance-ats-cvpr-2016/)

47,123 images from two cameras & lablled on pair.

5. [PKU-Vehicle](http://59.110.216.11/html/)

no ID lablled.

6. [CompCars](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/datasets/comp_cars/index.html)

136,726 + 27,618 images of 1,716 cars with attributes. After crop,  136,713.

7. [StanfordCars](http://ai.stanford.edu/~jkrause/cars/car_dataset.html)

16,185 images of 196 classes.
